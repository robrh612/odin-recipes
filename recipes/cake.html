    <p>Chocolate chestnut cake features a chestnut cream filling sandwiched between three decadent chestnut-studded chocolate cake layers. A rich chocolate glaze tops it all off for a chestnut- and chocolate-lovers dream.</p>
    
    <h2>Cake Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
        <li>baking spray</li>
    
        <li>1 cup 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate morsels (such as Ghirardelli®)</li>
    
        <li>¾ cup hot brewed coffee</li>
    
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    
        <li>¾ cup canola oil</li>
    
        <li>¾ cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
    
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    
        <li>2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    
        <li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li>
    
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    
        <li>¾ cup salted butter, softened</li>
    
        <li>2 (3.5 ounce) cans chestnut spread</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Glaze:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
    
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    
        <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with baking spray.</li>
    
        <li>Combine chocolate morsels and hot coffee in a medium bowl; let stand for 2 minutes and then stir until chocolate is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in eggs, oil, sour cream, and vanilla until smooth.</li>
    
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in egg mixture. Fold in chopped chestnuts. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans (about 2 cups per pan).</li>
    
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool in pans about 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Trim cooled cakes flat, if necessary.</li>
    
        <li>Beat powdered sugar, butter, and chestnut puree in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until filling is creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
    
        <li>Place 1 cake layer on a cardboard round cut to the same size as cake. Spread half of the filling onto the cake layer, spreading just slightly past the edge of the layer (about 1 cup). Repeat with a second cake layer and remaining filling. Top with final cake layer. Smooth excess frosting flush with the sides of the cake. Refrigerate cake until chilled, about 20 minutes.</li>
    
        <li>Place chocolate in a 4-cup glass measuring cup with a spout for the glaze; set aside. Bring cream and corn syrup to a low simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring occasionally. Pour cream mixture over chocolate, and let stand 2 minutes. Stir glaze with a spatula until completely smooth. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, until cooled to 100 to 105 degrees F (37 to 40 degrees C), 4 to 10 minutes. Glaze should be pourable and fluid.</li>
    
        <li>Remove chilled cake from the refrigerator, and place on a wire rack or inverted bowl inside a rimmed baking sheet. Quickly pour glaze over top of cake, allowing glaze to flow down the sides, making sure cake is completely covered. A spoon can be used to scoop up and reuse glaze to drizzle and coat sides. Let stand for 1 minute, allowing excess glaze to drip off the sides. Run an offset spatula around bottom edge of cake to remove any drips. Chill cake until glaze is set, about 1 hour. </li>
    </ol>
